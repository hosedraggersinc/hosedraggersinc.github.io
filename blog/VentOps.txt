Unfortunately, for the latter, it's ineptitude. The first fireground tactical priority is life safety - this includes firefighters and occupants. Water is great, but it can also create problems. In a superheated environment, you can steam burn potential survivors and, of course, yourself and your interior crew. It's best to remove the gases first, with a well-coordinated vent, then hit it with water. It doesn't take much, just a good hole up top, perhaps a louver cut, and let the science take over. It only takes a few seconds for those gases to escape. Sure, you will have to use a long hook and smash open the ceiling, but once that happens, you can use your charged line (if you have one) and hit the fire if it gets too crazy and to help reduce the chances of it from running across the rest of the roof.

Most of the time this would be better suited for overhaul. The better solution during overhaul would be PPV (Positive Pressure Ventilation). This is, of course, if you don't have vertical vent done or PPV obviously won't work. During the fire stage, horizontal ventilation is too risky if you have multiple interior crews (attack and search). If you feel the need to ventilation from inside - isolate, and use hydraulic ventilation. If you can't isolate, just ensure you are coordinating well with other crews. The problem with aydraulic ventilation, is it can take up valuable time while you could be continuing your primary. Ideally, this would be completed during your secondary or overhaul operation.

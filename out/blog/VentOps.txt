Most of the time this is better suited for overhaul. During the fire stage, horizontal ventilation is too risky if you have multiple interior crews. If you need to ventilate from inside, isolate and use hydraulic ventilation. If you can't isolate, ensure you coordinate well with other crews. The problem with hydraulic ventilation is that it can take up valuable time when you could be continuing your primary. Ideally, this would be completed during your secondary or overhaul operation.
